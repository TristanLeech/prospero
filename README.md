# About The Project

**This website was designed to allow users to create a calendar specific to their account, and populate it with events they wish to keep track of. The UI is intended to be uncluttered, with a minimalist aesthetic, in order to appear calming.**

The project was made using HTML, CSS, MySQL, and Node.js, with a React framework
