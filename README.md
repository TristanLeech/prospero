# About The Project

**This website was designed to allow users to create a calendar specific to their account, and populate it with events they wish to keep track of. The UI is intended to be uncluttered, with a minimalist aesthetic, in order to appear calming.**

The project was made using HTML, CSS, MySQL, and Node.js, with a React framework

The following can be installed by running 
```
npm install
```
and the necessary dependancy from the list below

## Frontend Dependencies

    @emotion/react
    @emotion/styled
    @mui/material
    @testing-library/dom
    @testing-library/jest-dom
    @testing-library/react
    @testing-library/user-event
    axios
    express
    mongodb
    mongoose

# Product Features

Prospero features several pages on which to view information

### -Landing and Login Pages
### -Calendar View
### -Task Addition View
### -Upcoming tasks

The user journey is intended to guide the user intuitively through the process, with the different pages allowing them to add their own events to their calendar, and the account system allowing them to access their information from anywhere

# Development Process

Hosting the site was on of the most difficult parts of the project, breaking half of the functionality

---

# Final Outcome


Large parts of the site remain broken, with database functionality and additional features still lacking

---

# Conclusion

Having full creative control of a site was freeing, and being able to know all the code, and not trying to familiarise myself with  unfamiliar code felt good. While large parts of the site need improvement as it stands, the project is pleasing
